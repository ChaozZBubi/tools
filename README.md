Some tools/scripts I might or might not use occasionally.

* scripts/mkscript - Bash script that creates small initial script/programming files

        ~$ mkscript python filename.py
        ~$ mkscript c filename.c

* hexchat/np.py - Now Playing script for mpd (and YouTube, though only with chromium)
* hexchat/spacko.py - Sends a random quote.
* hexchat/nohide.py - On channels, where Join/Part messages are hidden, this script will
  display Join/Part messages of users, that have interacted with the channel recently.
